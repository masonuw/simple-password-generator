# simple-password-generator

## Description

This is a simple password generator using mainly JavaScript and limited HTML and CSS. I built this website to test my JavaScript knowledge and skills and complete a project that could potentially be used in both my own and other's lives as a tool for safeguarding information. As well as refining my JavaScript function knowledge, I was also able to accomplish my goal of creating my first complex project combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation

This project requires no installation. It is a standalone website that only needs to be interacted with through the use of the "Generate Password" button.

## Usage

The use of the website is simple: simply click the "Generate Password" button on the screen and follow the prompts to collect your password. The following screenshot is an example of the page's layout and result when asking for a 25-character password using all options available.
